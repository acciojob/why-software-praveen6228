    <h1>"Why I want to become a developer?"</h1>
    <p>
      My curiosity for coding started already in 2018, when I signed up for a
      beginner programming course in Berlin (HTML & CSS), organized by “Tjejer
      kodar.” I started to slightly open the door to programming. I was
      immediately inspired by the women around me. They were all so creative,
      smart, and brave. However, due to my low self-esteem, I felt I was neither
      creative nor smart enough. Since I could not stop dreaming of becoming one
      of these women, I signed up for a course with “Tjejer kodar” held at the
      Swedish island Gotland. This time with an introduction to JavaScript. My
      curiosity increased, when I saw what actually can be built with code.
      However, my negative thought patterns still hindered me from taking the
      final step to change my career.
